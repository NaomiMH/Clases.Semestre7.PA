# P8. Data union and data structures as parameters
The Agency wants to save memory using Data Union.

They heard one of the many hacks you can implement on C with data union is to catch "unknown" data. The idea is to declare a data union that can act as any given data type. So you can save memory. Implement a program that will catch a value given by the user. This value could be either:

- Integer
- Double
- String (100 characters)

Please, re-use the code from practice 3, just add this new functionality.

When you are done, please upload your code on a word document. This document must contain two different test cases and proof it worked (in the form of pictures or video).

Tips:

Remember to apply the coding standard, or you can lose up to 20% of your assignment
