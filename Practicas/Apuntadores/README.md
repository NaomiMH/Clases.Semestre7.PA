# P7. Pointer Arithmetic

The agency needs to test a very basic program with a function that will do the following:

It will receive the address of the start of a string
Using what you learned about pointer math, run through the string and change the string according to the following table:

- a to 4
- e to 3
- i to 1
- o to 0
- u to 2

When you are done, please upload your code on a word document. This document must contain two different test cases and proof it worked (in the form of pictures or video).

Tips:

Remember to apply the coding standard, or you can lose up to 20% of your assignment.
