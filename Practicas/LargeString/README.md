Our senior Case Agents are working on a Keylogger, we need you to design the source code for the following routines:

- extremlyLargeString() that will get an increasingly large string from the keyboard.

When you are done, please upload your code on a word document. This document must contain two different test cases and proof it worked (in the form of pictures or video).

Tips:

Use getchar()
Define an escape character to end the capture process
Remember to free any allocated memory.
Remember to apply the coding standard, or you can loose up to 20% of your assignment
Use pointers to move arround the string.
