# P6. Recursion
Agent,

Again the Agency is looking up to you to creat a program that will calculate the following using recursion:

- The factorial of a given number
- N numbers on the Fibonacci sequence

When you are done, please upload your code on a word document. This document must contain two different test cases and proof it worked (in the form of pictures or video).

Tips:

Remember to apply the coding standard, or you can lose up to 20% of your assignment
