Agent,

We need your help, the Agency is code a big project and we need you ti pitch in. Code a program that will ask the user for two 2x2 matrices and will display the following:

The two matrices

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication

Make it modular, so we can integrate this easyly.

When you are done, please upload your code on a word document. This document must contain two different test cases and proof it worked (in the form of pictures or video).

Tips:

You somehow need to capture the matrices.

You can print only the answer to the operation.

Remember to apply the coding standard, or you can lose up to 20% of your assignment
